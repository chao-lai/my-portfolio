# Bonjour!

##### My name is Wenchao Lai. I'm a software engineer with internship experience and a focus in fullstack web development. My tech stack includes JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL & Apollo. Currently I'm an instructor leading an accelerator program (funded by NYC Tech Talent Pipeline) at Lehman College, training students in algorithms & data structures and preparing them for technical interviews. In my free time I like to contribute to open source projects. I am seeking junior dev roles.
